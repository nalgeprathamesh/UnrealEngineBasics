# 🎮 Unreal Engine 5 Learning Journey

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my personal Unreal Engine 5 (UE5) learning repository!  
This is where I document my learning path, share mini-projects, and build toward bigger ideas in the world of game development. 🚀

## ✅ Courses Completed / In Progress

- ✅ **[Unreal Sensei – UE5 Beginner Course (5 hours)](https://youtu.be/k-zMkzmduqI?si=8HsAsFuairkdwpz5)**  
  A great introduction that helped me understand the basics of UE5.

- 🔄 **[freeCodeCamp – Unreal Engine 5 for Beginners (11 hours)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1o0Nuq1BROk)** *(Ongoing)*  
  Currently diving deeper into workflows, blueprints, level design, and more advanced features.

## 🧪 Projects Made

### 🏰 CastleEnvironment Project

A basic open-world mini-game built as a hands-on project to explore core UE5 features.

**Skills & Concepts Explored:**
- 📦 Asset handling & property modification
- 🎨 Materials and material instances
- 💡 Lighting setup + Lumen system basics
- 🪨 Nanite virtualized geometry
- 🛠️ Blueprint scripting basics
- 🌊 Water bodies and physics
- 🌿 Foliage tools & terrain sculpting
- 🧱 World building and level design

> *This was my first full UE5 project (2025).  
I originally explored Unreal Engine during 8th–9th grade, but had to pause. Now, I'm back at it with full focus and intent to master it.*

## 🔮 Future Major Project – *Simulation theory based game*

🎭 **Story Concept:**  
A psychological sci-fi game where the protagonist discovers his world is a simulation.  
He must learn to manipulate and hijack the system to escape his fake reality. Expect elements of stealth, hacking mechanics, and narrative twists. Effort has also been made to add a deep narrative depth like in rdr2. 🧠💻🚪
