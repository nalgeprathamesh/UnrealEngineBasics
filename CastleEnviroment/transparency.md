# Transparency.md

This is the transparency log for the Castle Environment Project.

## 📜 Transparency Log  
### Ownership Breakdown

- ✅ **Completed by me**  
  - Created and modified materials and assets as per my own preferences  
  - Adjusted the environment to suit personal creative needs  
  - Inspired by the tutor, but I completed everything myself

- ⚙️ **AI-assisted**  
  - All notes were AI-assisted and created using Notion by uploading the course material to ChatGPT, then refining the responses, adding personal context, fixing inconsistencies, applying proper Notion structure, and exporting the final version to PDF  
  - Used AI to debug and fix minor issues, and to get information (e.g., how to package the game)  
  - Also asked AI clarifying questions (e.g., how `Nanite` and `Lumen` work) to understand the systems in depth

- 👨‍🏫 **Tutor-guided / Course-based**  
  - This entire project is based on the Unreal Sensei course: [YouTube Link](https://youtu.be/k-zMkzmduqI?si=8HsAsFuairkdwpz5)  
  - I followed the course closely as this was my first major project in Unreal Engine  
  - However, I also made significant modifications for my own use cases, and explored additional features of Unreal Engine 5 independently

## 🧠 Final Note

`Transparency.md` follows a standard format across all my repositories and projects — so they may appear somewhat identical.  
This project is part of my self-learning journey.  
I'm committed to learning honestly and deeply, so I’ve documented all external help or tools used.  
**No shortcuts — just real learning, real progress.**
